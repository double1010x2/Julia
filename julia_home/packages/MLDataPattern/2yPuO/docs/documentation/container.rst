Data Container
=============================

We have hinted in previous sections that we differentiate between
two "kinds" of data sources, which we called *iteration-based*
and *index-based* respectively. Of main interest in this section
are index-based data sources, which we will henceforth refer to
as **Data Container**. For a data source to qualify as such, it
must at the very least be able to provide the following
information:

1. The total number of observations :math:`N`, that the data
   source contains.

2. A way to query a specific observation or set of observations.
   This must be done using indices, where every observation has a
   unique index :math:`i \in I` assigned to it from the set of
   indices :math:`I = \{1, 2, ..., N\}`.

If a data source implements the required interface to be
considered a data container, a lot of additional much more
complex functionality comes for free. Yet the required interface
is rather unobtrusive and simple to implement.

- What makes a Julia type a data container are the implemented
  functions. That means that any custom type can be marked as a
  data container by simply implementing the required interface.
  This methodology is often called "duck typing". In other words,
  there is no abstract type that needs to be sub-typed. This fact
  makes the interface much less intrusive and allows package
  developers to opt-in more easily, without forcing them to make
  any architectural compromises.

- There is no requirement that the actual observations of a data
  container are stored in the working memory. Instead the data
  container could very well just be an interface to a remote data
  storage that requests the data on demand when queried.

- A data container can - but need not - be the data itself. For
  example a Julia ``Array`` is both data, as well as data
  container. That means that querying specific observations of
  that array will again return an array. On the other hand, if
  the data container is a custom type that simply serves as an
  interface to some remote data set, then the type of the data
  container is distinct from the type of the data (which is
  likely an array) it returns.

We will spend the rest of this document on discussing data
containers in all its details. First, we will provide a rough
overview of how the interface looks like. After that, we will
take a closer look at every single function individually, and
even see some code examples showing off their behaviour.

Interface Overview
-------------------------

For any Julia type to be considered a data container it must
implement a minimal set of functions. All of these functions are
defined in a small utility package called `LearnBase.jl
<https://github.com/JuliaML/LearnBase.jl>`_. This means that in
order to implement the interface for some custom type, one has to
import that package first. More importantly, it implies that one
does **not** need to depend on ``MLDataPattern.jl`` itself. This
allows package developers to keep dependencies at a minimum,
while still taking part in the JuliaML ecosystem.

There are only two methods that *must* be implemented for every
data container. In other words, implementing these two methods is
sufficient and necessary for a type to be considered a data
container.

=======================================  ===================================================================
Required methods                         Brief description
=======================================  ===================================================================
``nobs(data, [obsdim])``                 Returns the total number of observations in ``data``
``getobs(data, idx, [obsdim])``          Returns the observation(s) from ``data`` indexed by ``idx``
=======================================  ===================================================================

Aside from the required interface, there are a number of optional
methods that can be implemented. The main motivation to provide
these methods as well for a data container, is that they can
allow for a significant boost in performance in some situations.

=======================================  ===================================================================
Optional methods                         Brief description
=======================================  ===================================================================
``getobs(data, [obsdim])``               Returns all observations contained in ``data``
``getobs!(buf, data, [idx], [obsdim])``  Inplace version of ``getobs(data, idx, obsdim)`` using ``buf``
``gettargets(data, idx, [obsdim])``      Returns the target(s) for the observation(s) in ``data`` at ``idx``
``datasubset(data, idx, obsdim)``        Returns an object representing a lazy subset of ``data`` at ``idx``
=======================================  ===================================================================

Out of the box, this package implements the full data container
interface for all subtypes of ``AbstractArray``. Furthermore,
``Tuple`` can be used to link multiple data containers together,
and thus are considered quasi data container. They are accepted
everywhere data containers are expected, but they do have very
special semantics in the context of this package. For more
information about how ``Tuple`` are interpreted, take a look at
:ref:`tuples`.

Number of Observations
------------------------

Every data container must be able to report how many observations
it contains and can provide. To that end it must implement the
function :func:`nobs`. We will see that for some data containers
the meaning of "observations" can be ambiguous and depend on a
user convention. For such cases it is possible to specify an
additional argument, that denotes the observation dimension.

.. function:: nobs(data, [obsdim]) -> Int

   Return the total number of observations that the given `data`
   container can provide.

   The optional parameter `obsdim` can be used to specify which
   dimension denotes the observations, if that concept makes
   sense for the type of `data`.

   :param data: The object representing a data container.

   :param obsdim: \
        Optional. If it makes sense for the type of `data`, then
        `obsdim` can be used to specify which dimension of `data`
        denotes the observations. It can be specified in a
        type-stable manner as a positional argument, or as a more
        convenient keyword parameter. See :ref:`obsdim` for more
        information.

   :return: The number of observations in `data` as an Integer

We hinted before that :func:`nobs` is already implemented for any
subtype of ``AbstractArray``. This is true for arrays of
arbitrary order, even higher order arrays (e.g. images).

Let's start simple and take some random vector ``y`` as an
example. In the case of a vector (i.e. an one-dimensional array),
it is assumed that each element is an observation.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> y = rand(5)
   5-element Array{Float64,1}:
    0.542858
    0.28541
    0.613669
    0.217321
    0.018931

   julia> nobs(Y)
   5

If there is more than one array dimension, all but the
observation dimension are implicitly assumed to be features (i.e.
part of that observation). This implies that for an array, the
individual observations have to be explicitly laid out along a
single dimension.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> X = rand(2,5)
   2Ã—5 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.175347  0.61498   0.621127   0.0697848  0.454302
    0.196735  0.283014  0.0961759  0.94303    0.584028

   julia> nobs(X)
   5

As you can see, the default assumption is that the last array
dimension enumerates the observations. This can be overwritten by
explicitly specifying the ``obsdim``.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> nobs(X, ObsDim.First())
   2

   julia> nobs(X, obsdim = :first)
   2

   julia> nobs(X, obsdim = 1)
   2

Note how ``obsdim`` can either be provided using a type-stable
positional argument from the namespace ``ObsDim``, or by using a
more flexible and convenient keyword argument. We will discuss
observation dimensions in more detail in a later section.

Query Observation(s)
------------------------------

At some point in our machine learning pipeline, we need access to
specific parts of the "actual data" in our data container. That
is, we need the data in a form where an algorithm can
*efficiently* process it. This package does not impose any
requirement on how this "actual data" must look like. Every
author behind some custom data container can make this decision
him-/herself. In reality, it depends on what type the algorithm
one is working with expects (``Array`` is in general a good
choice). Providing a reasonable type is the responsibility of the
data container. To that end, every data container must implement
a method for the function :func:`getobs`.

.. function:: getobs(data, [idx], [obsdim])

   Return the observation(s) in `data` that correspond to the
   given index/indices in `idx`. Note that `idx` can be of type
   ``Int`` or ``AbstractVector``. Both options must be supported.

   The returned observation(s) should be in the form intended to
   be passed as-is to some learning algorithm. There is no strict
   requirement that dictates what form or type that is. We do,
   however, expect it to be consistent for `idx` being an integer,
   as well as `idx` being an abstract vector, respectively.

   :param data: The object representing a data container.

   :param idx: \
        Optional. The index or indices of the observation(s) in
        `data` that should be returned. Can be of type ``Int`` or
        some subtype ``AbstractVector{Int}``. Defaults to
        ``1:nobs(data,obsdim)``

   :param obsdim: \
        Optional. If it makes sense for the type of `data`, then
        `obsdim` can be used to specify which dimension of `data`
        denotes the observations. It can be specified in a
        type-stable manner as a positional argument, or as a more
        convenient keyword parameter. See :ref:`obsdim` for more
        information.

   :return: The actual observation(s) in `data` at `idx`.
        In what form is completely up to the user and can be
        specific to whatever task you have in mind! In other
        words there is **no** contract that the type of the
        return value has to fulfill.

Just like for :func:`nobs`, this package natively provides a
:func:`getobs` implementation for any subtype of
``AbstractArray``. This is again true for arrays of arbitrary
order.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> X = rand(2,5)
   2Ã—5 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.226582  0.933372  0.505208   0.0443222  0.812814
    0.504629  0.522172  0.0997825  0.722906   0.245457

   julia> getobs(X, 2) # single observation at index 2
   2-element Array{Float64,1}:
    0.933372
    0.522172

   julia> getobs(X, [1,3,5]) # batch of three observations
   2Ã—3 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.226582  0.505208   0.812814
    0.504629  0.0997825  0.245457

There are a few subtle but very important details about the above
code worth pointing out:

- Notice how the return type of ``getobs(::Array, ::Int)`` is
  different from the return type of ``getobs(::Array, ::Vector)``.
  This is allowed and encouraged, because these methods perform
  conceptually different operations. The first method returns a
  single observation, while the later returns a batch of
  observations. The main requirement is that the return type
  stays consistent for each.

- You may ask yourself why ``getobs(::Array, ...)`` returns an
  ``Array`` instead of a more conservative ``SubArray``. This is
  intentional. The idea behind :func:`getobs` is to be called
  *once* just shortly before the data is passed to some learning
  algorithm. That means that we do care deeply about runtime
  performance aspects at that point, which includes memory
  locality. This also means that :func:`getobs` is **not**
  intended for subsetting or partitioning data; use
  :func:`datasubset` for that (which does return a ``SubArray``).

- The type ``Array`` is both, data container and data itself.
  This need not be the case in general. For example, you could
  implement a special type of data container called
  ``MyContainer`` that returns an ``Array`` as its data when
  the method ``getobs(::MyContainer, ...)`` is called.

We mentioned before that the default assumption is that the last
array dimension enumerates the observations. This can be
overwritten by explicitly specifying the ``obsdim``. To visualize
what we mean, let us consider the following 3-d array as some
example data container.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> X = rand(2,3,4)
   2Ã—3Ã—4 Array{Float64,3}:
   [:, :, 1] =
    0.226582  0.933372  0.505208
    0.504629  0.522172  0.0997825

   [:, :, 2] =
    0.0443222  0.812814  0.11202
    0.722906   0.245457  0.000341996

   [:, :, 3] =
    0.380001  0.841177  0.810857
    0.505277  0.326561  0.850456

   [:, :, 4] =
    0.478053  0.44701   0.677372
    0.179066  0.219519  0.746407

Now what if we are interested in the observation with the index
``1``. There are different interpretations of what that could
mean. The following code shows the three possible choices for
this example.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> getobs(X, 1) # defaults to ObsDim.Last()
   2Ã—3 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.226582  0.933372  0.505208
    0.504629  0.522172  0.0997825

   julia> getobs(X, 1, obsdim = 2)
   2Ã—4 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.226582  0.0443222  0.380001  0.478053
    0.504629  0.722906   0.505277  0.179066

   julia> getobs(X, 1, obsdim = 1)
   3Ã—4 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.226582  0.0443222  0.380001  0.478053
    0.933372  0.812814   0.841177  0.44701
    0.505208  0.11202    0.810857  0.677372

   julia> getobs(X, 1, ObsDim.First()) # same as above but type-stable
   3Ã—4 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.226582  0.0443222  0.380001  0.478053
    0.933372  0.812814   0.841177  0.44701
    0.505208  0.11202    0.810857  0.677372

At this point it is worth to again (and maybe redundantly) point
out two facts, that we have already established when introducing
:func:`nobs`:

- If there is more than one array dimension, all but the
  observation dimension are implicitly assumed to be features
  (i.e. part of that observation). This implies that for an
  array, the individual observations have to be explicitly laid
  out along a single dimension.

- Note how ``obsdim`` can either be provided using a type-stable
  positional argument from the namespace ``ObsDim``, or by using
  a more flexible and convenient keyword argument. We will
  discuss observation dimensions in more detail in a later
  section.

It is also possible to link multiple different data containers
together on an per-observation level. To do that, simply put all
the relevant data container into a single ``Tuple``, before
passing it to :func:`getobs` (or other functions that expect a
data container). The return value will then be a ``Tuple`` of the
same length, with the resulting data in the same tuple-order.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> X = rand(2,4)
   2Ã—4 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.226582  0.933372  0.505208   0.0443222
    0.504629  0.522172  0.0997825  0.722906

   julia> y = rand(4)
   4-element Array{Float64,1}:
    0.812814
    0.245457
    0.11202
    0.000341996

   julia> getobs((X,y), 2) # single observation at index 2
   ([0.933372,0.522172],0.24545709827626805)

   julia> getobs((X,y), [2,4]) # batch of 2 observations
   ([0.933372 0.0443222; 0.522172 0.722906], [0.245457,0.000341996])

It is worth pointing out, that the tuple elements (i.e. data
container) need not be of the same type, nor of the same shape.
You can observe this in the code above, where ``X`` is a
``Matrix`` while ``y`` is a ``Vector``. Note, however, that all
tuple elements must be data containers themselves. Furthermore,
they all must contain the same exact number of observations. This
is required, even if the requested observation-index would be
in-bounds for each data container individually.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> getobs((rand(3), rand(4)), 2)
   ERROR: DimensionMismatch("all data container must have the same number of observations")
   [...]

When grouping data containers in a ``Tuple``, it is also possible
to specify multiple ``obsdim`` for each data container (if need
be). Note that if ``obsdim`` is specified as a ``Tuple``, then it
needs to have the same number of elements as the ``Tuple`` of
data containers.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> getobs((X,y), 2, obsdim = :last)
   ([0.933372,0.522172],0.24545709827626805)

   julia> getobs((X,y), 2, obsdim = (2,1))
   ([0.933372,0.522172],0.24545709827626805)

   julia> getobs((X,y), 2, ObsDim.Last())
   ([0.933372,0.522172],0.24545709827626805)

   julia> getobs((X,y), 2, (ObsDim.Last(),ObsDim.Last()))
   ([0.933372,0.522172],0.24545709827626805)

   julia> getobs((X',y), 2, (ObsDim.First(),ObsDim.Last())) # note the transpose
   ([0.933372,0.522172],0.24545709827626805)

Aside from the main signature for :func:`getobs`, it is also
possible to call it without specifying any observation
index/indices.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> X = rand(2,5)
   2Ã—5 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.226582  0.933372  0.505208   0.0443222  0.812814
    0.504629  0.522172  0.0997825  0.722906   0.245457

   julia> getobs(X)
   2Ã—5 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.226582  0.933372  0.505208   0.0443222  0.812814
    0.504629  0.522172  0.0997825  0.722906   0.245457

You may ask yourself what the purpose of this particular method
is. It is particularly useful for converting a data container
into the actual data that it represents. In contrast to calling
``getobs(X, 1:nobs(X))``, ``getobs(X)`` will not cause any memory
allocation if the given data ``X`` already is an ``Array``. In
other words, its main purpose is for a user to be able to call
``X = getobs(mysubset)`` right before passing ``X`` to some
learning algorithm. This should make sure that ``X`` is not a
``SubArray`` or :class:`DataSubset` anymore, without causing
overhead in case ``mysubset`` already is an ``Array`` (in which
case ``X === mysubset``).

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> X = rand(2,5)
   2Ã—5 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.226582  0.933372  0.505208   0.0443222  0.812814

    0.226582  0.933372  0.505208   0.0443222  0.812814

    0.504629  0.522172  0.0997825  0.722906   0.245457

By default ``getobs(X, obsdim)`` will call ``getobs(data,
1:nobs(data,obsdim), obsdim)`` for any type of ``data`` that does
not provide a custom method for it. If you are a package author
and your type has a more efficient (or conservative) way to
return the complete data set, you need to implement this method
yourself.

So far we have only discussed how to query observation(s) without
any regard for preallocation of the underlying memory. To achieve
competitive performance, however, it can be very crucial to reuse
memory if at all possible for the given data. For that purpose we
provide a mutating variant of :func:`getobs` called
:func:`getobs!`.

.. function:: getobs!(buffer, data, [idx], [obsdim])

   Write the observation(s) from `data` that correspond to the
   given index/indices in `idx` into `buffer`. Note that `idx`
   can be of type ``Int`` or ``AbstractVector``. Both options
   should be supported.

   Inplace version of :func:`getobs` using the preallocated
   `buffer`. If this method is provided for the type of `data`,
   then :func:`eachobs` and :func:`eachbatch` (among others) can
   preallocate a buffer that is then reused every iteration.
   This in turn can significantly improve the memory footprint of
   various data access pattern.

   Unless specifically implemented for the type of `data`, it
   defaults to returning ``getobs(data, idx, obsdim)``, in which
   case `buffer` is ignored.

   :param buffer: \
        The preallocated storage to copy the given observations
        of `data` into. *Note:* The type and structure should be
        equivalent to the return value of the corresponding
        :func:`getobs` call, since this is how `buffer` is
        preallocated by some higher-level functions.

   :param data: The object representing a data container.

   :param idx: \
        Optional. The index or indices of the observation(s) in
        `data` that should be written into `buffer`. Can be of
        type ``Int`` or some subtype ``AbstractVector{Int}``.

   :param obsdim: \
        Optional. If it makes sense for the type of `data`, then
        `obsdim` can be used to specify which dimension of `data`
        denotes the observations. It can be specified in a
        type-stable manner as a positional argument, or as a more
        convenient keyword parameter. See :ref:`obsdim` for more
        information.

   :return: Either the mutated `buffer` if preallocation is
        supported by `data`, or the result of calling
        :func:`getobs` otherwise.

Note that in contrast to typical mutating functions,
:func:`getobs!` does not always actually use ``buffer`` to store
the result. This is because some types of data container may not
support the concept of preallocation, in which case the default
implementation will ignore ``buffer`` and just return the result
of calling :func:`getobs` instead. This controversial design
decision was made for the sake of compatibility. This way,
higher-level functions such as :func:`eachobs` can benefit from
preallocation if supported by ``data``, but will still work for
data container that do not support it.

Sample Observation(s)
-------------------------------

Aside from requesting specific observations, we also allow to
sample observations at random. To that end we provide a
convenience function :func:`randobs`.

.. function:: randobs(data, [n], [obsdim])

   Sample a random observation or a batch of `n` random
   observations from data. The sampling is performed with
   replacement.

   :param data: The object representing a data container.

   :param Int n: \
        Optional. The number of observations to sample. If
        omitted a single observation is returned. Note that
        omitting is not equivalent to setting ``n = 1``. The
        latter will return a batch with just one observation in
        it.

   :param obsdim: \
        Optional. If it makes sense for the type of `data`, then
        `obsdim` can be used to specify which dimension of `data`
        denotes the observations. It can be specified in a
        type-stable manner as a positional argument, or as a more
        convenient keyword parameter. See :ref:`obsdim` for more
        information.

Just like for :func:`nobs` and :func:`getobs`, this package
natively provides a :func:`randobs` implementation for any
subtype of ``AbstractArray``. This is again true for arrays of
arbitrary order.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> X = rand(2,4)
   2Ã—4 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.226582  0.933372  0.505208   0.0443222
    0.504629  0.522172  0.0997825  0.722906

   julia> randobs(X, 3) # batch of observations
   2Ã—3 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.505208   0.933372  0.0443222
    0.0997825  0.522172  0.722906

   julia> randobs(X) # single observation
   2-element Array{Float64,1}:
    0.505208
    0.0997825

   julia> randobs(X, 1) # different to above
   2Ã—1 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.0443222
    0.722906

   julia> randobs(X', obsdim = 1) # note the transpose
   2-element Array{Float64,1}:
    0.226582
    0.504629

Similar to :func:`getobs`, you can again use a ``Tuple`` to link
multiple data containers on a per-observation level.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> X = rand(2,4)
   2Ã—4 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.226582  0.933372  0.505208   0.0443222
    0.504629  0.522172  0.0997825  0.722906

   julia> y = rand(4)
   4-element Array{Float64,1}:
    0.812814
    0.245457
    0.11202
    0.000341996

   julia> randobs((X,y)) # single observation
   ([0.933372,0.522172],0.24545709827626805)

   julia> randobs((X,y), 2) # batch of 2 observations
   ([0.0443222 0.505208; 0.722906 0.0997825], [0.000341996,0.11202])

For :func:`randobs` it is very important to use tuples in this
case (in contrast to :func:`getobs`, where it was optional). This
is because here it is crucial that every involved data container
samples the same observation index/indices. Otherwise the link
would be broken and the resulting observations do not correspond
to each other anymore.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   # WARNING: Wrong code! This is not equivalent to above
   julia> randobs(X), randobs(y)
   ([0.933372,0.522172],0.0003419958128361156)

.. _obsdim:

Observation Dimension
------------------------

By now we have seen multiple examples for a data container, where
there was no clear type-level convention for what exactly denotes
an observation. This is primarily the case for the rather
important family of data container, ``AbstractArray``.

To see another concrete example, let us consider the following
random matrix ``X``. This variable will serve as our toy feature
matrix.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> X = rand(2,4)
   2Ã—4 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.226582  0.933372  0.505208   0.0443222
    0.504629  0.522172  0.0997825  0.722906

Now that we see ``X`` before us, think about the following
questions: What is the number of features, and what is the number
of observations? It is the opinion of the package authors, that
the correct answer is "it depends", because there are two schools
of thought that both have their merits.

1. The typical convention in Statistics, as well as many
   frameworks, would be that ``X`` has 2 observations with 4
   features each. This convention makes sense and is intuitive,
   because one could easily see this matrix as a data table with
   2 rows and 4 column. Furthermore, this convention is used in a
   lot of text books and Machine Learning classes.

2. On the other hand, one could be compelled to say that this
   matrix ``X`` has 4 observations with 2 features each. This
   convention is particularly useful for the Julia language,
   because Julia stores the arrays in column-major order. This
   means that if we interpret each column as single observation,
   then all features of a single observation are right next to
   each other in memory. Making good use of this fact can have a
   big influence on performance (see the `corresponding section
   of the official documentation
   <http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/performance-tips.html#Access-arrays-in-memory-order,-along-columns-1>`_).

We decided quite early in the design process, that we want to
support both interpretations in a generic way. Furthermore, we
also wanted to support data container that don't have the concept
of "dimensionality" (i.e. where it is clear for the type what an
observation is). To that end, all relevant functions allow for an
optional parameter ``obsdim``, which can usually be specified as
either a keyword argument or a positional argument.

The following two code snippets show different ways to access the
first observation of some example feature matrix ``X``. In the
first snippet we assume that each row of ``X`` represents an
observation.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> X = rand(2,4)
   2Ã—4 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.226582  0.933372  0.505208   0.0443222
    0.504629  0.522172  0.0997825  0.722906

   julia> getobs(X, 1, obsdim = 1)
   4-element Array{Float64,1}:
    0.226582
    0.933372
    0.505208
    0.0443222

   julia> getobs(X, 1, obsdim = :first)
   4-element Array{Float64,1}:
    0.226582
    0.933372
    0.505208
    0.0443222

   julia> getobs(X, 1, ObsDim.First())
   4-element Array{Float64,1}:
    0.226582
    0.933372
    0.505208
    0.0443222

The second code snippet assumes that each column of ``X``
represents an observation

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> X = rand(2,4)
   2Ã—4 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.226582  0.933372  0.505208   0.0443222
    0.504629  0.522172  0.0997825  0.722906

   julia> getobs(X, 1)
   2-element Array{Float64,1}:
    0.226582
    0.504629

   julia> getobs(X, 1, obsdim = 2)
   2-element Array{Float64,1}:
    0.226582
    0.504629

   julia> getobs(X, 1, obsdim = :last)
   2-element Array{Float64,1}:
    0.226582
    0.504629

   julia> getobs(X, 1, ObsDim.Last())
   2-element Array{Float64,1}:
    0.226582
    0.504629

We can see that the default assumption for arrays is that the
last dimension enumerates the observations. Furthermore, it is
worth pointing out that while type-unstable, the keyword argument
``obsdim`` is more convenient to use than the (type-stable)
positional API. This is the main reason both alternatives exist,
because functionality wise they are identical. The positional
argument is intended to be used by code that cares about type
stability, while the keyword argument is mainly provided for
end-user convenience. Note that in the REPL, the performance
impact of using the keyword argument is negligible.

All possible values for the positional API are contained in the
namespace ``ObsDim``, which itself is provided by the package
``LearnBase.jl``.

.. class:: ObsDim.Undefined

   Default value for most data sources. It represents the fact
   that the concept of an observation dimension is not defined
   for the given data.

   Can usually be ommited.

.. class:: ObsDim.First

   Defines that the first dimension denotes the observations

.. class:: ObsDim.Constant{DIM}

   Defines that the dimension DIM denotes the observations

.. class:: ObsDim.Last

   Defines that the last dimension denotes the observations
